# Activity Log - Livestream Splitter Project

## 2025-07-20

### Project Initialization
- Created project directory at `/home/melek/github/livestream-splitter`
- Received PRD for Kick Livestream Splitter tool
- Project goals: Split long livestreams into 20-minute segments with intro/outro support

### Key Requirements from PRD:
- Core feature: Video segmentation (max 20 minutes per segment)
- Intro/outro integration support
- Smart splitting at natural breaks
- Command-line interface
- Support for multiple video formats (MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, FLV, WEBM)
- FFmpeg-based processing
- Local file processing (no direct Kick API integration yet)

### Project Planning Completed
- **Technology Stack Selected**: 
  - Python 3.8+ with Click CLI framework
  - FFmpeg for video processing (via ffmpeg-python wrapper)
  - YAML/JSON configuration with pydantic validation
  - pytest for testing
  - **NEW**: FastAPI + Vue.js/React for web UI

- **Architecture Designed**:
  - Modular structure with separate components for CLI, video processing, and configuration
  - Three-phase implementation plan (Foundation, MVP, Enhancement)
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery strategy
  - **NEW**: Web UI for easier configuration management

- **Project Structure Defined**:
  - src/stream_splitter/ for main code
  - tests/ for unit and integration tests
  - config/ for default configurations
  - examples/ for usage examples
  - **NEW**: web/ for web UI components

### Implementation Started
- Initialized git repository
- Created basic project directory structure
- User requested addition of web UI for configuration (to be implemented in Phase 3)

### Core Implementation Completed (MVP)
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Complete directory structure with proper Python packaging
- ✅ **Configuration System**: Pydantic-based config with YAML/JSON support and validation
- ✅ **Video Processing**: FFmpeg wrapper with metadata extraction, splitting, and concatenation
- ✅ **Main Splitter Logic**: Core splitting functionality with progress tracking
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: Full-featured Click-based CLI with all planned options
- ✅ **Utilities**: Helper functions for time parsing, filename sanitization, duration formatting
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples and troubleshooting
- ✅ **Configuration Examples**: Default config and batch processing examples
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Basic test structure with config and utility tests
- ✅ **Packaging**: setup.py with proper dependencies and entry points

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Video Splitting**: Configurable segment duration with FFmpeg integration
2. **Intro/Outro Support**: Automatic concatenation of intro/outro videos to segments
3. **Multiple Format Support**: MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, FLV, WEBM, TS
4. **Smart Configuration**: YAML/JSON config files with validation
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars using tqdm
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful error recovery
7. **File Management**: Configurable naming patterns and output organization
8. **Quality Control**: Adjustable codec settings and quality presets

### Project Status: MVP Complete
- All core functionality implemented and ready for testing
- CLI interface fully functional
- Documentation complete with usage examples
- Ready for real-world testing and feedback

### Next Steps:
- Test with real video files
- Add web UI implementation (Phase 3)
- Implement smart splitting features (scene detection)
- Add batch processing capabilities
- Performance optimization for large files
